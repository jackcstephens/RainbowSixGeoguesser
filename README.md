## WORK IN PROGRESS
## Rainbow Six Siege GeoGuesser

This game will mimic the GeoGuesser format, however, this time, it will use locations from Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege. It will feature:

- `Easy Mode`: You will be given random cameras and must match it to the map and exact location on the map earning points based on accuracy 
- `Hard Mode`: You will be given random drone shots and must match it to the map and exact location on the map earning points based on accuracy 
- `Statistics`: At the end of each round, see your avg accuracy, total points, and other data about your run
- `Leaderboard`: Plans for a leaderboard for the top scores are on the way
